# Meal Planner: Don't waste your food
Android application created as a project for course "Mobile and Ubiquitous computing and applications" at Frederick University,
Nicosia, Cyprus.

This application is supposed to be an inventory of all the things you bought to eat, displaying information about the quantity
and expiration date of the product.

Main idea behind it is to waste less food, create less trash and overall reduce amount of waste we produce.
